            Many people think that Blockchain is only limited to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin,however, the field of blockchain is much broader than that. Blockchain is a distributed immutable ledger that is completely transparent. 
            Let’s discuss each complex term one by one. 
            It is distributed which means every person in the network will have their own copy of the blockchain.
             It is immutable which means that the data of a block can not be modified.<br/><br/>
              A ledger is just like a notebook where we keep records of our transactions. 
              Blockchain is a decentralized system where all transactions or data are encrypted.
               As discussed, blockchain is a very powerful technology and that is why nowadays each and every company is trying to incorporate blockchain
                technology in their business, and hence they are looking for blockchain developers.

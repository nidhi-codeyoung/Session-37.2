            Tech-World Review is a bimonthly magazine wholly owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
            and editorially independent of the university. It was founded in 1899 as The Technology Review, 
            and was re-launched without "The" in its name on April 23, 1998 under then publisher R. Bruce Journey.
